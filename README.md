# Image-Reconstruction-using-CNN-Auto-Encoder
CNN Auto-Encoder Model which can take an image an reconstruct it
using an Auto-Encoder architecture.
Have performed many experimentations on CNN architecture by varying Representation Size, Number of Layers and Combination of CNN, MLP.

Using Encoded Representation of image from Auto-Encoder model, have developed a classification task to recognize the image
